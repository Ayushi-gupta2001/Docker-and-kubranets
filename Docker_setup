Docker setup 

Hello peps!!

I have installed Docker on Linux :

What i have done is , I launched an virtual machine on EC2. Here EC2 is an AWS service that we use to create Virtual machine. And on top of virtual machine we will run our
docker engine to manage containers.

So the first step is :
1) Launched an EC2 instance 
2) Access the EC2 instance through SSH 
3) yum update -y
4) yum install docker -y
5) systemctl start docker
6) systemctl status docker
