Why we need docker or container 

We write a code , we install various packages or software , dependencies that is required to run that code on our local enviorment or our development requirement or we can say in our 
local machine. 
Then we lock all that in a container.
Let's take an example here!!

We are working on a project that is required the node js version 14.0.1 , so we install that version and use that version for our use case. Then we write our code or
tested our applicatin in our development enviorment or local enviornement. Then we sent this code and excute the code to the production enviornemnt or any other system.

It suddenly shows error, but why?????????

Beacause all the dependenices that is required to run that code is not match the production env or other system's dependecies , so what we will do????

Of course, we will install the dependeices or requirment in our system, but don't you think it is teadious task????ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢
Becuase might be it doesn't work after doing all this. 

So , What can be solution for this???????


Here is the docker or kubernets picture comes:

We ship all the code its dependiencies it's required software in a container and now we can sent this container to any system where docker is running. And excute 
container simple!!.
We will further see how can a container excute.
But for now this is the basic idea why we use docker or container to match the enviorment of every system to excute application without any failure.
