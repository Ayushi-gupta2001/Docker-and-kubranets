Why Docker has so much priority rather than virtual machine ???????

Then main differene is : Container virtulize the operating system instead of hardware. Conatiner is more portale rather than virtual machine.
Continer are only meghabytes in size and uses the some byte of layer of operating system and take just a second to start.

Virtual machine is just like an another computer. VMs are an abstraction of physical hardware turning one server into many servers.
The hypervisor allows multiple VMs to run on a single machine. Each VM includes a full copy of an operating system, the application,
necessary binaries and libraries â€” taking up tens of GBs. VMs can also be slow to boot.


Dokcer container host on a simgle physical hardware with a host os. Sharing the host os between container make them light and increase the boot time.

In virtual machine if you want to share the your all the code into another production enviorment then you have to configure the production enviorment vms as the development 
enviorment vms.
