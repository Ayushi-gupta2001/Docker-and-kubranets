So,
What is Docker?

Docker is an container technolgy. It is a tool for creating and managing containers.

Then,
What is container here?

Container is nothing but a pacakge of code and dependecies that is required to run a code like java code or node js code in software development.

Okay, Let's go in simple word!!
ðŸ˜ƒ
let's relate container to a picninc basket, It might sound stange but we can understand the topic with picnic easilyðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ.

We have our picninc basket { realate to container } in which we have our fruits { here we can realate fruit with code of our application } or our 
disher { related to other dependecy to run that code }. Now whenever we go to picninc, we take our picnic basket and enjoy our picnic. 

We can also share that same picninc basket to your friend and that friend can also have same picninc.
So now could you realate to container with picninc basket?? Might not may be , but i will make sure that you would understand at the end of this chapter.


So Let's talk about container in our sdlc langugae.

In contianer we have a unit of software, a package of code or dependencies to run that code and this creats an enviorment which is independent and isolated from 
another container. Then we can take this container anywhere where docker runs and excute our container.
